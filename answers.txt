Part A:
    Unobserved variables:
We don't observe directly whether it rains or not, so «Rain» is an unobserved variable.
    
    Observable variables:
We observe wether the man has his umbrella or not, so «Umbrella» is an observable variable.

    Models:
Dynamic model (transition model:
    | 0.7 0.3 |
T = | 0.3 0.7 |

    | 0.9 0.1 |
B = | 0.2 0.8 |

    Assumptions:
We assume that the current state depend on a number of earlier states.
